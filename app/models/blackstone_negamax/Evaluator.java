/**
 * Evaluation function for Gomoku board positions. The evaluation works

 * stone on the board.

 *
 * The strength of a stone on the board is evaluated by looking at all 4
 * directions around the stone (vertical, horizontal, and two diagonals) - as
 * seen above. A window of length 5 is passed across each direction from the
 * start to the end and the amount of moves to create 5 consecutive stones is
 * recorded.
 *
 * For every five created in one move, the evaluator assigns 19 points, 15
 * for a five created in 2 moves, 11 for 3 moves, 7 for 4 moves and 3 for 5
 * moves. After the SCORES are calculated for every stone, the opponents
 * total strength is subtracted from the score and the current haslam.blackstone.players
 * strength is added to give a final value.
 *
 * This evaluation function was adapted from the open-source AI Carbon, created
 * by Micha≈Ç Czardybon.
